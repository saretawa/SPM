# SPM
A cross-platform package/software manager that first detects the platform and then attempts to find the appropriate package/software accordingly. It utilizes locally installed package managers, if available, and fetches a source list for a specific package. SPM installs and maintains the package by monitoring its version and updating it after a configurable delay, ensuring there are no flaws in the package. Agents execute commands from the server, including pushing new packages and sources, updating, and uninstalling. SPM follows an Agent-Server-based structure where the Server defines packages and sources, while the Agents use this information to perform actions.
